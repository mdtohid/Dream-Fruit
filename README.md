## how I made this site:

- First Went to themeforest to look for relavent sites I had in my mind
- I created components and hooks one by one and made site responsive
- I started routing all the components and setting up require auth
- Then I started authentication and made login and register components
- I made server side and then connected to my project and published my server side to vercel
- Then fetcehed all the data and showed in my client side
- After finishing all the work I look for mistakes if I missed any

## Tools and utilites used for this Site:

---

- `React-bootstrap` `react-router` `firebase-authentication-hook` ` react-taostify` etc.
